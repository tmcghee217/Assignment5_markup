		<h2>Family Life</h2>
		<p>My life currently revolves around my daughter.  Grace was born premature, and was in the <abbr title="Neonatal Intensive Care Unit">NICU </abbr> <!--If you want the user to see the expansion without hovering over the abbreviation, you may want to type (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) here in parentheses.--> for 12 days; however, she is now two years old and is an active, happy toddler.  We keep a fairly busy schedule with preschool, music class, activities at church, and frequent play dates or trips to the library. </p>

I could set both width and height here, or I can choose only the width and the browser will maintain the aspect ratio.  An even better choice is to resize it in an image editor so the file is smaller.  Notice already the file size differences in the img folder.-->
		<p>Grace attends <a href="http://web4.superb.net/elearn/">Early Learning</a> two days a week, and this semester we signed up for Bongos class at <a href= "http://www.champaignschoolofmusic.com/music-together-overview.html"> Champaign School of Music</a>. Earlier this year she was in dance, and next spring we're considering joining <a href="http://www.soccerplanetcu.com/lk">Soccer Planet</a>.  Thankfully, in Champaign we have many opportunities to exercise her mind, body, and spirit.</p>
		<p>My husband and I also have two small dogs; both are rescues.  Buster came from a rescue in Missouri.  He is now nearly 15 years old and is showing his age.  We adopted Ruthie from the Champaign County Humane Society<sup>1</sup> 7 years ago, and she is still a fun and loving addition to the family.</p>

		<h2>Work</h2>
		<p>I currently teach two sections of CIS 152: Web Development and Design I and one of CSC 175: JavaScript.  These classes overlap greatly.  For example, the <code>textAlign</code> property of an element will allow a JavaScript developer to use CSS to change the alignment of the text in HTML.  Including <code>document.body.style.textAlign=”right”;</code> will align the text in the body to the right.  Here is another small snippet of code that we worked on recently in class: </p>
		<pre>	
		<code>
			var number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
			
			for (var i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) {
				var guess = prompt("Enter guess #" + i + " (1..100)");
			
				if (guess &lt; number) {
					alert("Too small");
				} else if (guess &gt; number) {
					alert("Too big");
				} else {
					alert("Got it");
				}
				
				if (i === 10) {
					alert("That’s enough guessing");
				}
			}
			
		</code>
		</pre>
		<p>Can you guess what it does?</p>
		
		<p>I am on campus three days a week this semester and also work on the weekends.  If you see me in D208 or B227<sup>2</sup>, feel free to stop by and ask questions or chat.</p>
		<p>In the past I have taught math at a couple other community colleges, CSC 105 and CIS 122 here at Parkland.  I have been at Parkland for 7 years now.  Prior to rejoining the academic world, I worked for Amdocs, Busey Bank, and temporarily at a law firm in town.</p>

		<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
		<p>In my free time, I like to do <dfn>paper crafting</dfn> which is "the collection of art forms employing paper or card as the primary artistic medium for the creation of three-dimensional objects" (<cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_craft">wikipedia.com</a></cite>). <!--I would not typically give you the definition of paper crafting, but for the purposes of our work in HTML, I want to show you this use of the <dfn> and <cite> elements.-->  Mostly I enjoy making cards that I never send and thinking how nice it would be to make some scrapbooks to pass down through the generations.</p>
		<p>I also like to cook and bake, although I don't take much time to do it these days.  I do sometimes read about cooking though, like this selection from <cite>Green Eggs and Ham</cite>:</p>
		<blockquote>  <!--I use blockquote because it's a multiple-line quote.-->
			<pre>  <!--I use pre because I want to preserve current spacing and line breaks.-->
			Do you like 
			green eggs and ham?
			I do not like them, Sam-I-am.
			I do not like
			green eggs and ham.

			Would you like them 
			here or there?

			I would not like them
			here or there.
			I would not like them anywhere. 

			I do not like
			green eggs and ham.
			I do not like them, Sam-I-am.
			</pre>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I even like to make a menu each week.  It helps us to eat healthier and feel more prepared.  It also helps to make a shopping list and get the proper fresh produce when we'll use it.  Notice in the sample menu in Figure 1 that we like to eat a variety of foods each week.</p>

		<P>Finally, I like to visit museums and zoos and aquariums.  My favorite animal is the sea star.  Most aquariums have a selection of the common starfish, but there are stunning ones including the <i lang="la">Astropecten articulatus</i>.  I haven't seen many varieties of sea stars in the wild, but I suppose that's part of living in the midwest.</P>
		<!-- Notice that I used the <i> tag there.  You should use <em> for emphasis, and typically you will style anything that just needs to be italicized in CSS, but I want you to see the only time you might even consider using the i tag in HTML. -->

	<p><sup>1</sup>I highly recommend CCHS if you're looking for a new pet.  Hospice Hearts is another worthy organization if you're so inclined.</p>
	<p><sup>2</sup>You may be more likely to find me walking through the halls than in B227, but the point is that you can stop and chat no matter where I am, unless I'm in a class, of course.</p>
